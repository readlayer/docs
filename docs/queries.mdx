## Types

### Strict

Use it when you are looking for the exact term.

By default, it is:
- Diacritic-Sensitive
- Case-Insensitive
- Matches partial words

:::tip
You can always change the diacritic, case sensitivity, or whole word matching directly in the item settings.
:::


#### Examples

Query: `page`

> The <HL>page</HL>s are red

> You can find that text on the same <HL>page</HL>

> <HL>Page</HL> number 5

Query: `canción`

> La cancion sonaba sin parar

> Toca otra vez esa <HL>canción</HL>


### Regex

Use regular expressions to highlight.

#### Examples

Query: `East Midlands|West Midlands|London`

Goal: find any of the terms "East Midlands", "West Midlands", or "London".

> The differences between the <HL>East Midlands</HL> and the <HL>West Midlands</HL> I only found out when I moved to Cov.

---

Query: `(\p{N})+`

Goal: find numbers

> The current population increase is estimated at <HL>67</HL> million people per year

> Page number <HL>5</HL>

---

Query: `\p{Sc}`

Goal: find currency symbols

> In November 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, in an all-stock <HL>$</HL>2.6 billion deal

---

Query: `(stop)\w*`

Goal: find all words starting with "stop"

> Please <HL>stop</HL> there

> You are <HL>stopping</HL> at the end

---

Query: `([\w\.\-]+)@([\w\-]+)((\.(\w){2,3})+)`

Goal: find email addresses in a page or document

> Contact me at <HL>gerard@online.com</HL>.


### Similar

Find similar terms or passages.

:::tip
If you use double **quotes** `"`, ReadLayer will behave in the same way as with the [Strict](#strict) query.
You can combine strict and similar terms or sentences.
:::

By default, this type of query will use your **language** settings defined in _Settings > Language_.
However, you can fine tune each of your queries to use a different language. Once you have created a new item, adjust its language in the item settings.

:::note
Currently, ReadLayer finds related terms by inflection, not semantically.

#### Examples

Query: `"miR-378"`

Goal: find exact match

> <HL>miR-378</HL> suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by inhibiting SDAD1

---

Query: `"miR-378" "SDAD1"`

Goal: find passages where the terms "miR-378" and "SDAD1" are near each other

> We found that miR-378 expression was low in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-378 not only inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, but also inhibits migration and invasion by inhibiting the EMT of colon cancer cells.
<HL>SDAD1 is a direct target gene of miR-378</HL>. We also confirmed that miR-378 alleviated the malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Conclusion: <HL>miR-378 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by targeting SDAD1</HL>.

Query: `"BORIS" regulation`

Goal: Find the term "BORIS" near related terms to "regulation".

> The evolution of epigenetic <HL>regulators CTCF and BORIS</HL>/CTCFL in amniotes.
